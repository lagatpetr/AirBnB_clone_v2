0x02. AirBnB clone - MySQL
Do you remember the unittest module?

This codebase contains many test cases. Some are missing, but the ones included cover the basic functionality of the program.

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ 
All your unittests must pass without any errors at anytime in this project, with each storage engine!. Same for PEP8!

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ HBNB_ENV=test HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK

Some tests won’t be relevant for some type of storage, please skip them by using the skipIf feature of the Unittest module - 26.3.6. Skipping tests and expected failures. Of course, the number of tests must be higher than the current number of tests, so if you decide to skip a test, you should write a new test!

How to test with MySQL?
First, you create a specific database for it (next tasks). After, you have to remember what the purpose of an unittest?

“Assert a current state (objects/data/database), do an action, and validate this action changed (or not) the state of your objects/data/database”

For example, “you want to validate that the create State name="California" command in the console will add a new record in your table states in your database”, here steps for your unittest:

get the number of current records in the table states (my using a MySQLdb for example - but not SQLAlchemy (remember, you want to test if it works, so it’s better to isolate from the system))
execute the console command
get (again) the number of current records in the table states (same method, with MySQLdb)
if the difference is +1 => test passed
